# Nyx Programming Language

Nyx is a new programming language that combines the syntax of Python and JavaScript. It is designed to be fast, easy to read, easy to write, resource efficient, and cross-platform compatible. Nyx compiles to native executables for various operating systems.

## Features

- Combines the best features of Python and JavaScript
- Easy-to-read syntax
- Interprets `.nyx` files directly without compilation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)

### Building Nyx

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nyxland/nyx.git
   cd nyx
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```sh
   bun install
   ```

3. Build the project using the TypeScript compiler (tsc):

   ```sh
   bun run build
   ```

### Running Nyx Code

To run Nyx code, use the `cli` JS file generated in the build process. The `cli` JS file takes a Nyx source file as input and interprets it directly.

```sh
bun run dist/cli.js path/to/your_code.nyx
```

This will interpret and execute the Nyx code in the specified file.

### Example of Using the New CLI Interface

To run a Nyx source file, use the following command:

```sh
npx nyx example/index.nyx
```

This will interpret and execute the Nyx code in the `example/index.nyx` file.

## Nyx Syntax

Nyx syntax combines elements of Python and JavaScript. Here are some examples:

### Variables

```nyx
let x = 10
const y = 20
```

### Functions

```nyx
def add = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Conditionals

```nyx
if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y");
else:
    print("x is not greater than y");
```

### Loops

```nyx
for i in range(10) {
    print(i);
}
```

### Classes

```nyx
class Person:
    def __init__ = (self, name, age) => {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }

    def greet = (self) => {
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old")
    }
```

## Project Status

The Nyx programming language now has a working parser and interpreter. The parser can handle function declarations, variable declarations, and other statements. The interpreter correctly handles function declarations and calls, including the `main` function. The example code in `example/index.nyx` runs without errors, demonstrating the functionality of the language.

## Parser and Interpreter

The parser and interpreter for Nyx have been implemented to support a combination of JavaScript and Python syntax. The parser generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the source code, and the interpreter executes the AST.

### Parser

The parser is responsible for converting the source code into an AST. It supports the following features:

- Function declarations
- Variable declarations
- If statements
- For statements
- While statements
- Return statements
- Import declarations
- Expression statements

### Interpreter

The interpreter executes the AST generated by the parser. It supports the following features:

- Function calls
- Variable assignments
- If statements
- For loops
- While loops
- Importing modules
